# SOAP-API-Country-Information-Retrieval

This GitHub project provides a Python script for retrieving country information using SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) requests. It includes two main functionalities:

1.Fetching Country Codes: The script makes a SOAP request to obtain a list of ISO country codes from a web service. These codes are used to uniquely identify countries.

2.Getting Capital Cities: Using the retrieved country codes, the script then makes individual SOAP requests to fetch the capital cities of each country. The data is processed and stored in a DataFrame.

Features:

*SOAP requests using Python's requests library.
*Data parsing with xml.etree.ElementTree.
*Organized code structure with functions for code reusability.
*Data storage in a Pandas DataFrame.

Usage:
1.Clone the repository.
2.Run the script to fetch country information.
3.Access the data in a Pandas DataFrame for further analysis or export to different formats.

Happy coding! :)
